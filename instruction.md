✅ Step-by-step Instructions
1. Install Git via Homebrew (if you haven’t already):

brew install git
This usually installs Git in /opt/homebrew/bin/git (on Apple Silicon) or /usr/local/bin/git (on Intel Macs).

2. Check where Homebrew Git is installed:

which -a git
You should see something like:

/opt/homebrew/bin/git
/usr/bin/git
You want the Homebrew one (first path) to be used.

3. Update your shell profile to prioritize Homebrew Git:

Depending on your shell:

For Zsh (default on modern macOS):
Edit your ~/.zshrc file:

nano ~/.zshrc
Add this line at the top:

export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"
(Use /usr/local/bin if you're on Intel.)

Then reload your config:

source ~/.zshrc
4. Verify it worked:

git --version
You should now see something like:

You should now see something like:

git version 2.44.0
Instead of the older system Git (e.g., 2.30.x).


Use git-credential-manager (Cross-platform alternative)
If you want a cross-platform credential manager (like on Windows), you can install Git Credential Manager (GCM).

Install:

brew tap microsoft/git

brew install --cask git-credential-manager-core

Configure Git to use it:

git-credential-manager-core configure

That will update your Git config to use GCM as the credential helper.

✅ Check what helper is active:
git config --global credential.helper


git version 2.44.0
Instead of the older system Git (e.g., 2.30.x).
